    <p>while the planet earth turns round you will definatly love the view of it in a3 bedroom house,2bathrooms,living room, study,kitchen, spar roomand a pool area.A surplus of chimneys badly built at jaunty angles stuck out preposterously, giving the roof the look of an eccentric party hat, the roof was pitched at such a sharp angle that no roofer had dared go on it to repair the missing slate tiles that had blown off in last November's storm. The front window was a large bay giving it's owner lots of opportunities for curtain twitching. </p>
